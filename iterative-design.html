        <h2 class="page-h2" id="text-2" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Iterative design is an assignment in Brown University's CSCI 1300 in which people form groups to design an interactive interface based on the problem that the emerging startup has. The group will go through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept.
           For this project, my group chose the startup called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/re-mint">re-mint</a>. We chose re-mint because we were passionate about their mission. After reading their mission description, we could immediately picture 
          how the website designs would look like. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2 class="page-h2" id="text-2">Background</h2>
      <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">RE-MINT MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
      <p>Re-mint lets fashion brands set up official secondhand marketplaces so their customers can buy and sell directly with each other. We help brands monetize their resale market. We offer revenue share on transaction fees and use the transaction data to drive new sales. For example, if an Everlane customer sells her jeans because they are too small, we retarget her to purchase the larger size from Everlane's main e-commerce website.</p>
    </p>  
      <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">PROBLEMS TO SOLVE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="bullet">Lack of personalization: on current brand websites, there is little direct interaction with customers during the shopping process to guide them to ideal products</li>
        <li id ="bullet">Lack of brand presence in the resale market: on current secondhand sites, brands aren't tied to sellers and rely on sellers to market their items</li>
        <li id="bullet">Lack of user engagement: on current brand websites, there is little contact with customers after they buy their products</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">TARGET USERS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="bullet">Old/returning users of the featured brands</li>
        <li id="bullet">New users who can casually scroll through the website</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users who don’t want to spend too much money on clothing and would buy secondhand</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users who want to earn extra money by selling their old clothes</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users who don’t have the time to go to or who get overwhelmed by thrift stores or secondhand stores that are not organized by brand</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users who would prefer to online shop on desktop and like to have more choices on their screens at once</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users with disabilities or visual impairments who prefer using computers to online shop or do online tasks</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users in need of outfits for special occasions but who are not able to travel to a specific store due to location/transportation issues</li>
        <li id="bullet">Users who have physical disabilities that make it difficult to travel to a physical store</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
    
      <h2 class="page-h2" id="text-2"><a class = "subtitle" id="low-fi">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</a></h2>
      <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">Interface Decision</h3>  
      <ul>
        <li id="bullet">We chose <strong>desktop</strong> because it will allow more features to be displayed on the website and make features on the website more accessible due to the larger screen size. Also, it would help users feel more comfortable making online purchases as we learned through our user interviews that people feel more confident making online purchases through desktop.
        Overall, we felt the most confident designing re-mint for desktop devices because we feel that it can benefit the most amount of users.</li>
    
        <li id="bullet">However, we do recognize the limitations of choosing desktop: users who do not have computers may not have access, casual/frequent users may prefer using phones for a convenient and fast shopping experience, and sellers could have a difficult time uploading photos on desktop</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li class = "mt-4" id="bullet">Solution: Our application ensures that brands have a presence in the resale market. Brands are able to verify that items being sold are legit based on the data produced by the clothing generator and from the sale of items. 
           In addition, our application increass user engagement and user personalization.

        <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li id="bullet">Feature that lets users sell clothes - helps consumers feel more connected to the platform and benefit from making money from unused clothing.</li>
        <li id="bullet">We host brands where users can buy secondhand clothing items that have been verified and marked down from their original price - increases consumer engagement and trust while also supporting brands hosted on the platform</li>
        <li id="bullet">When users first sign up, they are directed to pages that will help the user filter the products that are shown to them - helps users have a personalized shopping experience since they are only shown products they want.</li>
        <li id="bullet">Brands and consumers can directly talk to each other (with the intention of the consumer being directed to the actual brand site to complete another purchase) - increases engagement and personalization and builds relationships between brands and customers</li>
        <li id="bullet">A quiz section where users are able to find out their style preferences and the website will generate recommendations for the users - increases user personalization.</li>

      <ul>
        <li id="bullet">Make entire navbar buttons clickable, not just words</li>
        <li id="bullet">On the log in page, add a log in header</li>
        <li id="bullet">The clothes, price range, etc. page is a little crowded and the positioning of the skip for now button is slightly unintuitive</li>
        <li id="bullet">On the selling page, differentiate clothing items by labeling them with descriptions (not just photo items)</li>
        <li id="bullet">Quiz page should have footer with more padding and color to separate it from the rest of the page</li>
        <li id="bullet">On the Lululemon brand page, use an off-white or lighter color background and have shadow for cards so they stand out</li>
        <li id="bullet">Make the "add to cart" button stand out more</li>
        <li id="bullet">Use bolder font for title header to show hierarchy</li>
        <li id="bullet">Looks mid-fi and not high-fi because too much white space and dimensionless</li>

    <h2 class="page-h2" id="text-2"><a>User Testing</a></h2>  
      <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">Instructions Provided to Users</h3>
      <p>Re-mint is a secondhand buying and selling website, and you are a new customer doing both of these tasks. Our outlined task for you is to create a new account and heart different favorite brands (hover only for now due to Figma limitations), and then submit to begin shopping. We then want you to shop specifically for Lululemon clothes and checkout, and then finally sell your old Zara clothes.</p>
      <p>Currently, we are in an interactive mockup stage, and we are designing in Figma with limited functionality, so please assume that information is pre-filled for you and that some things are only hoverable (limited amount of clicks per page). However, please attempt to use our website as realistically as possible, click through the different pages, and think aloud. Thank you!</p>

      <h3 class = "page-h3" id="border">Email to Re-mint</h3>  
      <p>Hi Jeevika and Sam,
    
        <br><br>Hope you are doing well! Our names are (name), (name), (name), and (name), and we are all Brown University undergraduates taking a class called “User Interfaces and User Experiences.” For one of our projects, we were tasked with choosing a startup and mocking up a solution to the startup’s concept. 
        
        <br><br>We were very interested in your startup with the goal of creating a secondhand marketplace with increased user engagement and connection with brands. We have created a ten page prototype using Figma with many different features, including a home page, quiz page, shop page, sell page, feed page, and more! 
        
        <br><br>Aligning with your startup’s goal, we wanted to target two groups of users: sellers and buyers. Thus, we hoped to create a seamless buying experience for customers looking to buy secondhand items from brands they already love or help them explore different brands too. On the flip side, we aimed for buyers to be able to have a convenient experience of selling their items. Specifically, we integrated this feature where buyers who are looking to sell their clothes but want that item in a different type (color, size, etc), our user-centered prototype will redirect them to the brand’s site so they’ll be able to make that purchase. Also, we wanted to make this experience very personalized for the user through a chat feature (called feed), allowing users to favorite brands, and a quiz to match users with clothes that fit their style. 
        Please check out the link to our Figma!: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/DaS9QXemD0ZJ4uJTaTKnWY/Iterative-Design?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0%3A1&viewport=-11905%2C-5750%2C1.86&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=260%3A482">link</a>
        
        <br><br>We would love to hear your thoughts about our mockup! We really appreciate your time reading this email and looking through our Figma. Hope to hear from you soon! 
        
        <br><br>Thank you!
        <br>(name), (name), (name), and (name)

        <h3 class="page-h3" id="border">Other Features We Would've Added if Space Allowed</h3>  
        <ul>
          <li id="bullet"> Re-mint hosts online contests for the best customized brand item, which is chosen by the brand. Afterwards the brand sells the winning item and the revenue is divided between the designer and brand.</li>
          <li id="bullet"> A point rewards system to encourage sellers to continue selling items on the website</li>
          <li id="bullet"> Re-mint provides users a platform to post outfit suggestions from their closet. Brands would then select the best outfit post. The winning post would have links to the brand website.  Afterwards if other customers are encourgaed to purchase the clothing items because of the outfit posts, both the brand and the user who made the outfit suggestions would benefit. 
           
        </ul>

          <h2 class="page-h2" id="text-2" style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"> Project Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In this project we gained insights into the design process - from sketching, to creating low-fi wireframes and high-fi wireframes, and how user critique influences designs.
