				<p>
					Development is an assignment in Brown University's CSCI 1300 in which students individually practice creating a webpage in ReactJS.
          In this assignment, I developed an interactive Squishmallow interface using components and then tied these components to an internal data state. I created a list-based interface, which allowed users to sort, filter, and aggregate components.

            <h3 class="page-h3" id="border-green">Goal and Value of the Application</h3>

            <p>This application is a Squishmallow collection webpage. The goal is for the user
            to be able to be able to sort and filter their Squishmallows and also favorite
            their favorite Squishmallows and display them accordingly. (Sorting is based on
            either name or price, and filtering is based on type or rarity). The value of my
            application is for Squishmallow fans like myself! I would find it convenient to
            view my Squishmallows digitally, especially since I can't carry all of them
            on the plane with me :'( This could also be replicated for other collectible
            items too like Pokemon cards, coins, etc. so that collectors can have their
            items organized with them wherever they go.</p>

			
			<div>
			<h3 class="page-h3" id="border-green">Usability Principles Considered</h3>

			<button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Learnability</button>
			<div class="panel-green">
				<p>I felt that nav bars are intuitive and if they have an arrow,
                that implies a dropdown menu. Also, I thought that the checkbox is also 
                intuitive in the navbar because if you click it, you expect the favorites to
                be displayed. Also, I tried to use clear terms such as Sort By, Filter By Type,
                and Filter By Rarity and also in the dropdowns too, also including the filtering
                conditions. </p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Memorability</button>
			<div class="panel-green">
				<p>The color palette and fonts were inspired by the ones that the
                    Squishmallow brand uses. Also, I feel like once the user uses the page at least
                    once, it is pretty simple to understand where everything is since the 
                    functionality is all concentrated at the top with dropdowns and a checkbox.</p>
			</div>
			<button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Efficiency</button>
			<div class="panel-green">
				<p>Having all the sorting/filters in a line at the top with dropdown 
                    menus makes it easy for the user to access since they do not have to scroll 
                    around.</p>
			</div>


            <h3 class="page-h3" id="border-green">Organization of Components</h3>

            <p>The App Component is the main component (created in App.js file) that acts as a 
                container or parent for the other component that we created called SquishItem 
                (created in SquishItem.js file). App is the parent component and it contains the
                data for the page and the sorting and filtering functionalities. App 
                communicates with its child SquishItem through props which I will go over in 
                my next answer. SquishItem is a child component that returns the display card
                for each Squishmallow and handles when the favorite button is clicked
                and the corresponding functionality. </p>


            <h3 class="page-h3" id="border-green">How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h3>

            <p>Data is passed down from the App component (App.js) to the SquishItem component
                (SquishItem.js) using props. In App.js we have filteredData.map((item) => ( 
                 < SquishItem item={item} key={item.name} setTotal={setTotal} favProducts=
                 {favProducts} setFavProducts={setFavProducts}/>))
                In this case, we are calling the child component of SquishItem and displaying
                on screen what is in the return statement from SquishItem for each item in
                filteredData. Regarding how to get the data to fill each component, the data
                from App.js is in the curly braces "{}" after the equals sign, and the 
                name of the prop is before the equals sign. Then, in SquishItem, we are able
                to access the data from App.js using the prop name. For example, if we
                want to access the favProducts list in SquishItem, we can use prop.favProducts.</p>
			
            
            <h3 class="page-h3" id="border-green">How the User Triggers State Changes</h3>
                <button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Sorting</button>
                <div class="panel-green">
                    <p>Declaring the state for sort: const [sort, setSort] = useState("AtoZ");<br>
                        Initially, sort is set to the default "A to Z". Then, whenever the user clicks
                        an option in the "Sort By" navbar dropdown, an eventKey that corresponds
                        to the selected option is passed into setSort, and then sort is set to that
                        value. Then, the items displayed on the screen are sorted based on that option
                        that sort has been set to (A to Z, Price: Low to High, and Price: High to Low)
                        using the .sort() filter.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Filter By Type</button>
                <div class="panel-green">
                    <p>Declaring the state for type: const [type, setType] = useState("All");<br> 
                        Next, the filters are set to their default "All," which does not filter out any
                        items. For the "Filter By Type" filter, if a user clicks on an option
                        in the "Filter By Type" navbar dropdown, an eventKey that corresponds to the
                        selected option is passed into setType, and then type is set to that value.
                        Then, the items are checked individually in the matchesFilterType function, and
                        return true if the item's type is equal to the type that was just set and false 
                        if not (or always return true if "All" is selected). Then, the items that have
                        false returned are filtered out, and the ones that have true returned are
                        displayed on the screen.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Filter By Rarity</button>
                <div class="panel-green">
                    <p>Declaring the state for rare: const [rare, setRare] = useState("All");<br>
                        Similar to above, just replace type with rare! I created a "Filter By Rarity"
                        navbar dropdown that each filter option has an eventKey which when the user
                        clicks on the option, then the eventKey is passed into setRare that sets rare 
                        to that value. Then, the items are returned either true or false depending 
                        whether the item's rare value match the rare value that was set, and are removed
                        from the screen if false.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Favorite Heart Button</button>
                <div class="panel-green">
                    <p>Clicking the favorite button with the heart at the bottom of each item triggers 
                        multiple state changes. First, in SquishItem.js, I declared a state for the like
                        setting: const [like, setLike] = useState(false);. False is when the item is not 
                        favorited and true is when it is favorited. When the user clicks the heart, the
                        opposite of what like is set to is passed into setLike, which is what triggers
                        whether the empty heart (false) or the filled heart (true) is displayed on the
                        button. <br><br>
                        Also, favProduct is changed when the user clicks the button, and this
                        state (declared as const [favProducts , setFavProducts] = useState([]);)
                        was passed from App.js to SquishItem.js as a prop. When like is true, the item
                        is added to the favProducts list, and if it is false, then the item (if it
                        exists) is removed from the list. Also, whenever this happens, the total cost of
                        all the favorited items is calculated and using setTotal (which is another state
                        that we declared: const [total, setTotal] = useState(0);), the total is updated
                        on the screen. 
                        </p>
                </div>
                <button class="accordion" id="dropdown-green">Favorite Checkbox</button>
                <div class="panel-green">
                    <p>This favProducts list is then used in App.js when the Favorites checkbox 
                        is checked. This is the final state that the user can trigger: 
                        const [favChecked, setFavChecked] = useState(false);. Initially,
                        the checkbox is unchecked/false and this leaves the screen unchanged, but
                        when the checkbox gets checked, then favChecked turns to true. Then,
                        similar to how we filtered, the items that aren't in the favProducts list are
                        filtered out, and only the favProducts or items with the like button true are
                        displayed.
                        </p>
                </div>
